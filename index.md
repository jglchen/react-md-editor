A Markdown editor app with **React.js** is built to facilitate editing Markdown documents. The **WYSIWYG** editor allows users who may be less experienced with Markdown to use familiar toolbar buttons and shortcuts. In addition, the html output is shown simultaneously when editing Markdown document.

Markdown is not a syntax that an average user will be familiar with, nor is it visually clear while editing. In otherwords, for an unfamiliar user, the syntax they write will make little sense until they view the result. This app has been designed to bridge this gap for non-technical users who are less familiar with or just learning Markdown syntax.
